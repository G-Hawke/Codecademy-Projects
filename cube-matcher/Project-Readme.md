# Project Readme

---

The Goal of this project was to edit GameScene.js. 
We had to use our existing knowledge of iterators, higher order functions and call back functions, and javascript coercion.

## Version 1:

The reason this is already named version one was becase I intend to go back to this project at a later date.
I initialy struggled combining all of the concepts above as I was making assumptions which didn't bare any fruit till let in the code.
My goal is to revist this project and to run through the tasks given to be able to understand which points are my cruxes and what I should focus more learning on.

All in all, version one was a good project as it taught me a lot about my own knowledge and where I lack deeper understanding.
